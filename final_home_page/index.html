            <h3>Some Neat Frogs:</h3>
            <p><strong>The Australian Green Tree Frog</strong>, also known as the Dumpy Tree Frog, is a species of tree frog native to Australia and New Guinea. <br>
                The green tree frog is a plump, rather large tree frog, and can grow up to 11.5 cm in length, with fully grown females being slightly larger than males. <br>
                 Green tree frogs are insectivores. They feed on a diet of flies, mosquitoes, crickets, and other small insects.</p>

            <p><strong>The Glass Frog</strong> may look like a common tree frog, but it has a distinguishing translucent abdomen that allows their heart, liver, and gastrointestinal tract to be seen from underneath! <br>
             This frog's diet mainly consists of small insects like crickets, moths, flies, and spiders. But they have also been known to also eat smaller frogs. <br></p>

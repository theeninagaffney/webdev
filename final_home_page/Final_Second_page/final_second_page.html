                <li><p>Frogs have longer legs! Their legs are made for hopping and leaping.</p></li>
                <li><p>Frogs are very smooth and like to stay moist- they drink through their skin. They are also prone to losing water very quickly once they leave their wet habitats.</p></p></li>

            <ul>
                <li><p>Toads have much shorter legs- they travel mainly by crawling.</p></li>
                <li><p>Toads have dry, bumpy skin that is often riddled with warts. Their skin is more water-proof than that of a frog's and they can withstand dry environments much better because of it.</p></li>
